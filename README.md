Some projects that I made/am making with ideas from Arcadia TTT gaming community. 

These ideas, or at least most of them are not mine, therefore although I maintain copyright over expression of the idea, I do not feel that I should not make the work publicly accessible.
Most of this work has not been looked into in a long time, relative to how much I have learned since last attending to them.
I was originally intending on releasing these on Steam - Garry's Mod workshop but for several reasons I decided against this. 
<ol>
  <li>As stated prior, I did not come up with these ideas (majority)</li>
  <li>I am a terrible artist and as such do not have either icons nor artwork for the landing page</li>
  <li>Again, as said prior, these have not been looked at in a while, I know that there are improvements that could be made, I have simply lost a lot of motivation, especially without people to help test them.</li>
  <li>I'd like to be able to contribute slightly to the community, somewhere for someone to look at to maybe take some inspiration and either finish them and release them, by all means do so or at least learn what not to do</li>
</ol>
Although I have not looked at this in a while, I do plan on trying to update these at some point to be better written.
